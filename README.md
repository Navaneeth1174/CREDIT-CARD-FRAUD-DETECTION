# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION

Problem Statement: Credit Card Fraud
Detection

Background
Credit card fraud is a significant issue faced by financial
institutions and customers worldwide. Fraudulent
transactions can lead to substantial financial losses and
undermine consumer trust in digital payment systems. With
the increasing volume and sophistication of fraudulent
activities, there is a pressing need for robust and efficient
detection mechanisms. Data science, particularly machine
learning, offers powerful tools to identify suspicious
transactions and reduce the incidence of fraud.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine
learning model that accurately detects fraudulent credit card
transactions using a historical dataset. The model should be
capable of distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent
transactions in real time, minimizing false positives and
false negatives to protect both customers and financial
institutions.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains transactions made by European
cardholders in September 2013. It includes transactions that
occurred over two days, with 492 frauds out of 284,807
transactions, making the dataset highly unbalanced. The
positive class (frauds) accounts for only 0.172% of all
transactions.

The dataset is as follows:

The dataset comprises only numerical input variables
resulting from a PCA transformation. Due to confidentiality
issues, the original features and more background
information about the data are not provided. Features V1,
V2, ... V28 are the principal
components obtained with PCA. The only features not
transformed with PCA are:

Time: The seconds elapsed between each
transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
Amount: The transaction amount, which can be

used for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning.
Class: The response variable, taking a value of 1 in
case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Given the class imbalance ratio, it is recommended to
measure the accuracy using the Area Under the
Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), as confusion matrix
accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

Key Challenges

1. Imbalanced Data: Fraudulent transactions are
rare compared to legitimate transactions, leading to a
highly imbalanced dataset.
2. Feature Engineering: Working with PCA
transformed features limits the ability to generate
domain-specific features.

3. Model Performance: Achieving high accuracy
while maintaining a low rate of false positives (legitimate
transactions flagged as fraud) and false negatives
(fraudulent transactions not detected).
4. Real-Time Detection: Ensuring the model can
process transactions quickly and accurately in a real time
environment.

5. Adaptability: The model should adapt to
evolving fraud tactics over time.

Approach

Data Preprocessing:
Handle any potential missing values.
Normalize and standardize the 'Time' and 'Amount'
features.
Ensure that the PCA-transformed features are
appropriately scaled.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze transaction patterns.
Visualize the distribution of fraudulent vs. non
fraudulent transactions.
Identify correlations between features.

Feature Engineering:
Utilize the 'Time' and 'Amount' features for additional
insights.
Consider interactions between PCA components.

Model Development:

Evaluate various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural
Networks).
Address class imbalance using techniques such as
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
or class weighting.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model
performance.

Model Evaluation:
Use cross-validation to assess model robustness.
Evaluate performance using metrics such as Precision,
Recall, F1-Score, and particularly the Area Under the
Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC).

Deployment and Monitoring:

Deploy the model in a real-time environment.
Implement monitoring to track model performance and

update it as needed.

Success Metrics
AUPRC: The primary metric to measure the model's
performance in handling imbalanced data. Precision
and Recall: Measure the model's effectiveness in
detecting fraud without generating excessive false
alarms.
F1-Score: Balance between precision and recall.

ROC-AUC: Modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between
classes.
